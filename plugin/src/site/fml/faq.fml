        <faq id="maven31">
            <question>What versions of maven will the plugin work with?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>The plugin requires maven 3.1.1 or higher.</p>
            </answer>
        </faq>
        <faq id="startProc">
            <question>Why is there a server process still running when executing the start goal?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    In version 1.1+ of the plugin the start goal was changed to the leave the server process running. If
                    previously you relied on the maven process ending to shutdown the server you should now execute the
                    shutdown goal before the maven process ends.

        <faq id="beforeAfterCommands">
            <question>Why were the <code>&lt;beforeDeployment/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;afterDeployment/&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;beforeAdd/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;afterAdd/&gt;</code> options removed?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    These options are redundant since the <code>execute-commands</code> goal could be run before and/or
                    after a deployment goal.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </faq>
        <faq id="executeCommands">
            <question>Why was the <code>&lt;executeCommands/&gt;</code> option deprecated?</question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    The complex <code>&lt;executeCommands/&gt;</code> configuration parameter has been deprecated in favor
                    of using the simple parameters. All configuration parameters can now to the parent configuration
                    element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To migrate from previous versions of the plugin simply remove the surrounding
                    <code>&lt;executeCommands&gt;&lt;/executeCommands&gt;</code> element from your configuration leaving
                    the children elements.
